# noitaJejeAutoSplitter
I created this autosplitter for Noita to cover as many categories as possible, as I couldn't find a complete solution elsewhere.

I made it to work by default with [Smickles Splits](https://www.speedrun.com/noita/resources/tvoht), but changing the config in the Scriptable Auto Splitter settings (In the Layout Settings) should make it work with almost any layout (that I can think of) for other categories (Except orb-based splitting, since at least for now I haven't figured out how the game keeps track of orb pickups).

# Requirements
It needs the [Enable Logger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2124936579) mod to work  and if you dont have Noita installed in the default folder (for windows) you will need to change it in the als, on the init section, the logPath variable.

#Note
This MAY break if the game updates (Only the Completed Screen detection).
