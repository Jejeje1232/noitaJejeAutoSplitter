# noitaJejeAutoSplitter
I created this autosplitter for Noita to cover as many categories as possible, as I couldn't find a complete solution elsewhere.

# Requirements
It needs the Enable Logger mod to work (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2124936579) and if you dont have Noita installed in the default folder (for windows) you will need to change it in the als, on the init section, the logPath variable.

#Note
This MAY break if the game updates (Only the Completed Screen detection).
